[General]

# INTRODUCTORY WARNING! Don't set silly values. Fire up the terminal and type in "sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/breeze-514" first to see what you've done by changing this file.

# (KDE option) WALLPAPER FADER VISIBLE. I don't really understand this option, look further down if you want to turn off the wallpaper fader.
#+  Default=image
type=image

# (KDE option) SET BACKGROUND COLOR. This is only relevant if you don't have a wallpaper, or if your wallpaper does not occupy the entire screen (see 'fillType' below). In the latter case, this is the color of the screen outside the wallpaper boundaries.
#+  Default=#1d99f3
color=#333333

# (KDE option) SET WALLPAPER. If you want a different wallpaper every time, set this to a symbolic link and have a separate process/script periodically change the image to which the link points. The images and the link should be outside any user's home directory.
#+  Default=/usr/share/wallpapers/Next/contents/images/3200x2000.png
#background=/usr/share/wallpapers/Next/contents/images/3200x2000.png
background=/var/ak/Pictures/login-screen/login-bg

# This specifies how to render a wallpaper image with dimensions that are different from those of the screen. The value must be one of the following (without the quotes).
#+  Default: "PreserveAspectFit"
#+    "Stretch" - the image is scaled to fit
#+    "PreserveAspectFit" - the image is scaled uniformly to fit without cropping
#+    "PreserveAspectCrop" - the image is scaled uniformly to fill, cropping if necessary
#+    "Tile" - the image is duplicated horizontally and vertically
#+    "TileVertically" - the image is stretched horizontally and tiled vertically
#+    "TileHorizontally" - the image is stretched vertically and tiled horizontally
#+    "Pad" - the image is not transformed

fillType=PreserveAspectFit

# SET SCREEN DIMENSIONS. E.g. 1920 and 1080.
#+  Defaults: ScreenWidth=1600 and ScreenHeight=900
ScreenWidth=1920
ScreenHeight=1080

### [Blur & fader] -------------------------------------

# SET BLUR STRENGTH. You're adjusting FastBlur's radius here. If you set the value to 0 you will turn off the blur entirely.
#+  Default=100
BlurRadius=0

# SET WALLPAPER FADER STRENGTH. This is the bit of code that darkens your wallpaper. To turn it off set the value to 0; to have it fully operational set it to 1. Use decimal values between those two for adjustments.
#+  Default=1
WallpaperFaderStrength=

# TURN ON TEXT SHADOWS. If you've turned off both the blur and the fader, text will not be legible. Turn on text shadows by setting the following value to "true".
#+  Default=false
TextShadowsVisible=true

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT PANEL AT THE BOTTOM. This is another fix if you've turned off the blur and fader; set to "true" if you need it.
#+  Default=false
PanelVisible=true

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CIRCLE BEHIND AVATAR. Another fix for non-blurred and non-shaded themes; set to "true" if you need it.
#+  Default=false
DrawCircleBehindAvatar=true

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CIRCLE BEHIND ACTION ICONS. Another fix for non-blurred and non-shaded themes; set to "true" if you need it.
#+  Default=false
DrawCircleBehindActionIcons=true

### [Fonts] -------------------------------------

# SET FONT NAME. E.g. Lato
#+  Default=Noto Sans
Font=

# SET FONT HINTING STYLE. Values are: PreferDefaultHinting, PreferNoHinting, PreferVerticalHinting, PreferFullHinting.
#+  Default=PreferDefaultHinting
FontHinting=

# SET FONT POINT SIZE. E.g. 11
#+  Default=10
FontSize=

# SET CLOCK FONT SIZE. E.g. 40
#+  Default=48
ClockSize=

# SET DATE FONT SIZE. E.g. 20
#+  Default=24
DateSize=

### [Icons] -------------------------------------

# SET AVATAR SIZE. This option is currently broken, see bug report on GitHub.
# AvatarPixelSize=

# CHANGE AVATAR OUTLINE COLOR. I've mainly added this option so you can use it as a hack to turn off the avatar outline. Just type in "transparent" below and you're good to go.
#+  Default=PlasmaCore.ColorScope.textColor
AvatarOutlineColor=

# SET ACTION ICONS' SIZE. E.g. 64
#+  Default=iconSize (note: this is probably 48 in pixels so take that as a guideline)
ActionIconSize=

# CHANGE THE ICON THEME. Unforunately there is no easy and straightforward way to change the icons. For messy ways of changing them see: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395027#c10 and if using option 1 remember that the folder for Manjaro is /usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/breath.
